        name: "Beef and Mustard Pie",
        preView: "https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sytuqu1511553755.jpg",
        ingredients: "1kg beef, 2 tbsp plain flour, 2 tbs rapeseed oil, 200ml red wine, 400ml beef stock, 1 finely sliced onion, 2 chopped carrots, 3 sprigs thyme, 2 tbs mustard, 2 free-range egg yolks, 400g puff pastry, 300g green beans, 25g butter, pinch salt, pinch pepper",
        instructions: "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Toss the beef and flour together in a bowl with some salt and black pepper. Heat a large casserole until hot, add half of the rapeseed oil and enough of the beef to just cover the bottom of the casserole. Fry until browned on each side, then remove and set aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef. Return the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, onion, carrots, thyme and mustard, and season well with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and place in the oven for two hours. Remove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool. Remove the thyme. When the beef is cool and you're ready to assemble the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Transfer the beef to a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten egg yolks and lay the pastry over the top. Brush the top of the pastry with more beaten egg. Trim the pastry so there is just enough excess to crimp the edges, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through. For the green beans, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and toss with the butter, then season with black pepper. To serve, place a large spoonful of pie onto each plate with some green beans alongside."

        name: "Beef and Oyster pie",
        preView: "https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wrssvt1511556563.jpg",
        ingredients: "900g beef, 3 tbs olive oil, 3 shallots, 2 cloves minced garlic, 125g bacon, 1 tbs chopped thyme, 2 bay leaf, 330ml stout, 400ml beef stock, 2 tbs corn flour, 8 oysters, 400g plain flour,pinch salt, 250g butter, toglaze eggs",
        instructions: "Season the beef cubes with salt and black pepper. Heat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat. Do this in three batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof casserole dish once it is browned all over. Add extra oil if the pan seems dry. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Pour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven for 1½-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced. Skim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob – don’t forget that it will be hot – and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool. Increase the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches. Gradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water – you may not need it all – and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for the pie lid. Roll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/¾in larger than the dish you’re using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling."

Return the beef to the pan, sprinkle flour over and coat the meat and onions Add the stock to the pan, stir well and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 1½ hours without a lid. If the liquid evaporates too much, add more stock. Remove from the heat. Add salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce and allow to cool completely. Place the cooked meat mixture into a pie dish. Roll out the pastry to 5mm/¼in thick and 5cm/2in larger than the dish you are using. Using a rolling pin, lift the pastry and place it over the top of the pie dish. Trim and crimp the edges with your fingers and thumb. Brush the surface with the beaten egg mixture and bake for 30-40 minutes until golden-brown and puffed. Serve with creamy mash and steamed vegetables to soak up the gravy."

        name: "Red Peas Soup",
        preView: "https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sqpqtp1515365614.jpg",
        ingredients: "2 lbs beef, 2 cups kidney beans, 1 large carrots, 2 chopped spring onions, 4 sprigs thyme, diced onions, 1 dicen onion, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 chopped red pepper, 4 mashed garlic clove, 1 tbs allspice, 2L water, 4 potatoes, 1 cup plain flour, 1/4 cup coconut milk",
        instructions: "Wash and rinse the dried kidney beans. Then cover with water in a deep bowl. Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job. Have your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in. Time to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins. Basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart. It’s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Now is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. Allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape. Add them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil. You’ll notice that I didn’t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools. While this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day."
